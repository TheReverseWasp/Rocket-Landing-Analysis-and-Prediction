# Rocket-Landing-Analysis-and-Prediction

In this project I recollect data from SpaceX landings, analyze it, and create predictive models looking to assess successful landing based on preprocessed data. 

 

I also create a functional dashboard that works with libraries such as `dash` and `pandas`. 

 

The overall repository organization is: 

 

## Data recollection: 

- jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb 
- jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb 

 

## Data analysis and dashboard building (EDA) 

- jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb 
- edadataviz.ipynb 
- lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb 
- labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb 
- spacex_dash_app.py 

## Model Building  

- SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb 

Enjoy.
